# Title
“Music Recommendation System”
## Team members

## Project decription
- This project aims to develop a music recommendation system that suggest songs based on user mood, activity level, and time of day. Using a combination of neural networks and fuzy logic, the system will improve personalized music reccomendations. 
- Data Set:
- User Mood on a 1-10 scale
- Activity level on a 1-10 scale
- Time of day on a 0-24 scale. It is on a scale of 24 hours due to 24 hours in a day.
- Genre preferences (pop, rock, country, hip hop, r&b, classical, etc.)
- Data Set of 20-30 songs, maybe Top Songs of 2024
- when the song is given, it will also output an image of the artist. 
## Project Goals 
- Train a neural network to predict music genres based on user inputs
- Use different architectures such as fully connected layers
- Modify some hyperparamters such as number of layers, neurons per layer, and batch size
- Use fuzzy logic to refine tempo of music, which correlates to Beats per Minute (BPM), and energy level recommendations
